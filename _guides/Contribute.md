Have a cool piece of code, tutorial, or demo you'd like to share with other people curious about machine learning? Consider contributing one to [ml4a-guides](https://ml4a.github.io/guides/). 

At the moment, we have few official guidelines. In the future, some guidelines will be drafted here or in the [Github Wiki](https://github.com/ml4a/ml4a-guides/wiki). Have a look at the other guides listed for ideas of style, and content. ml4a-guides are currently distributed as either markdown files (tutorials) stored on the [ml4a.github.io repository](https://github.com/ml4a/ml4a.github.io/blob/master/_guides) or as Jupyter Notebooks (with python code) in the [ml4a-guides repository](https://github.com/ml4a/ml4a-guides).
